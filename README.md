# MSc-final-project
My MSC final project. It will be an interactive map of Portsmouth tracing Doyle's movements in the city. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle lived and worked in Portsmouth for 8 years. The project is to create a mobile application that presents a guided tour to sites of interest around Portsmouth to visit locations related to Conan Doyle and other notable events.
